## Short-Circuit based DG placement study in a MV Network 

An automatic Short Circuit Assessment-based tool is developed for Distributed Generation Placement. Powerfactory add-on script and Userâ€™s Manual is developed and provided to the Engineers, Saving hours of engineering jobs via automation of short-circuit study and obtaining valuable data for decision making.

## Automatic Migration of Excel formatted power system Data into CYME                          

Client-customized Excel spreadsheet power system data is directly migrated into cyme software using excel macros, SQL, and Microsoft access.
Extensive Data was transferred with no error, and a manual was created on how to use the code to do the automatic migration.
