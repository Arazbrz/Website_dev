## Imbalance Constrained Cross Phase Quadratic OPF for Optimal Integration of EV Chargers and PV Inverters in Meshed and Radial Distribution Systems 

### Under Review

ABSTRACT: Inverter-Based distributed energy resources, specially Photovoltaic devices (PVs) and electric vehicle charge stations (EVCS) in the sequel of the power-electronics interface, provide unprecedented flexibility to the system, such as the ability to transfer line power across phases. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for per-phase optimal active, reactive, and cross-phase power flow dispatch of PVs and EVCSs. The optimization problem is targeted to maximize the firm benefit of DSO subject to the operational constraints, including unbalanced situation tolerability of loads. The problem is formulated as a quadratic objective function with linearized constraints to maintain tractability with many per-phase meshed buses and constraints. A new approximate equation of voltage unbalance factor (VUF) is introduced and used alongside existing linearized equations of other constraints. The framework's applicability is validated via the unbalanced multi-phase IEEE 33 bus and IEEE 192 bus systems. The results show that the cross-phase capability of PVs and EVs and VUF consideration can significantly help the system to satisfy the voltage imbalance limits while increasing the maximum profit in both their operational and nonoperational modes.
