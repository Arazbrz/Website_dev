## [Reliable fault-ride through and protection of converter-dominated power systems under unbalanced conditions](https://wispo.ece.wisc.edu/projects/pserc-s-95-reliable-fault-ride-through-and-protection-of-converter-dominated-power-systems-under-unbalanced-conditions/)
##### MATLAB/SIMULINK
Power electronics interfacing renewables, storage, and novel transmission technologies are envisioned to be the cornerstone of tomorrow’s resilient and sustainable power systems. While state-of-the-art power converter control can replace grid-forming and grid-supporting functionalities of synchronous machines, their design typically neglects crucial aspects such as unbalanced faults and the interaction between converter protection (e.g., current limiting) and system-level protection. This jeopardizes system reliability and resilience and has already resulted in large-scale system outages and separation events. This proposal is focused on development of a framework that explicitly accounts for current limits, unbalanced conditions, and protection in the control design. The proposed approach will enable reliable and predictable fault-ride through capabilities that do not rely on heuristics, avoid adverse interactions with system protection, and retain the positive impact of grid-forming control on system-level stability when feasible.

## AC and DC Microgrid Power Sharing Design and Study
##### PLECS/MATLAB PID Tuner
In this project first the control scheme of the standealone AC genertors in a microgrid is designed. In the second phase, the inverters are connected to each other and the various loads in different power quality and faulty situations. In the third phase a distributed and centralized tertiary control scheme is designed to operate the microgrid.
